# Spam-Email-Classifier
Classification algorithms allow us to categorize data into predefined classes or labels. Whether it’s predicting customer churn, detecting spam emails, or diagnosing diseases, these techniques are at the heart of predictive modeling.

Key Steps in Classification:
Data Preparation:
Cleanse your dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. A solid foundation ensures accurate predictions.
Model Selection:
Explore a variety of classification algorithms:
Logistic Regression: A workhorse for binary classification.
Decision Trees: Intuitive and interpretable.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Powerful for complex boundaries.
Choose the right algorithm based on your problem and dataset characteristics.
Model Training:
Divide your data into training and testing sets.
Train your chosen classification model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:
Metrics matter! Assess your model’s performance using:
Accuracy: Overall correctness.
Precision: How many predicted positives are truly positive.
Recall: How many actual positives were captured.
F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Cross-validation ensures your model generalizes well.
